# Server Architecture

The server (`server/`) is the authoritative simulation layer. It owns the canonical game state, runs the selected game library as a shared library, and delivers entity snapshots to clients each frame. For the default Warcraft III build, game logic lives in `games/warcraft-3/game/` and is built as `libgame`.

## Startup

`SV_Init` (`server/sv_main.c`) runs at process startup:

1. Loads the game library (`libgame.so` / `game.dylib`) via `dlopen` and obtains a `game_export_t *` pointer by calling `GetGameAPI`.
2. Calls `ge->Init()` to let the game library set up its global state.
3. Calls `SV_InitGame` which reads the map archive, spawns world entities (doodads, pre-placed units, starting locations), and notifies the game library that a new map has loaded.

## Main Loop

`SV_Frame(DWORD msec)` is called from the platform main loop alongside `CL_Frame`. Unlike the client, the server advances only when its monotonic real-time clock reaches the next fixed `FRAMETIME` (100 ms) simulation deadline:

```c
void SV_Frame(DWORD msec) {
    svs.realtime += msec;
    SV_ReadPackets();    // network remains live even while simulation is paused
    if (sv.paused) {
        if (paused_keepalive_due)
            SV_SendClientMessages(); // frozen frame/time; prevents timeout
        return;                       // do not advance ge->RunFrame()
    }
    if (svs.realtime < sv.next_frame_msec)
        return;          // not yet time for a new game frame
    sv.next_frame_msec = SV_ClampSimulationDeadline(
        svs.realtime, sv.next_frame_msec);
    SV_RunGameFrame();   // 1. advance simulation
    sv.next_frame_msec += FRAMETIME;
    SV_SendClientMessages(); // 2. send snapshots to clients
}
```

This fixed-step approach decouples the simulation rate from the render rate and makes replay and deterministic simulation practical. `SV_SetPaused()` gates only simulation advancement; transport stays active, and resuming rebases `sv.next_frame_msec` so paused wall-clock time is not simulated as catch-up work. Warcraft III pause policy is documented in [Pause And Modal UI](../games/warcraft-3/pause-and-modal-ui.md).

`SV_Frame` executes at most one simulation step per outer-loop call. Before that step it applies `SV_ClampSimulationDeadline`: normal sub-tick lateness is preserved, but if the simulation deadline is more than one `FRAMETIME` behind wall time the deadline is rebased to the current `svs.realtime`. This follows Quake II's server policy of never allowing a multi-tick wall-clock stall to become a long burst of catch-up simulation. It is especially important for the local-client architecture because synchronous map loading and renderer/resource registration can block the outer loop for seconds. That wall time is loading latency, not simulation work, and must not later be replayed as consecutive 100 ms game ticks at render-loop speed.

A September 2026 WC3 campaign trace confirmed the failure mode directly: multi-second map-load stalls left the server several seconds overdue; at a ~15–16 ms render-loop cadence, each subsequent outer iteration advanced the fixed simulation by 100 ms until the backlog drained, making JASS/camera time run roughly six times faster than wall time. The deadline clamp removes that debt while preserving ordinary scheduler jitter. The regression is covered by `server_net.scheduler_clamps_multi_tick_wall_clock_backlog`. See [WC3 Cinematics](../games/warcraft-3/cinematics.md) for the campaign symptom.

Reference behavior: id Software Quake II `server/sv_main.c`, `SV_RunGameFrame`, clamps server realtime when the simulation falls behind so the engine does not replay an arbitrarily large backlog after a stall.

### 1. SV_ReadPackets

Drains the network receive buffer (loopback ring or UDP socket) for each connected client slot. Dispatches `clc_*` messages:

| Opcode | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `clc_connect` | Allocate a client slot, send `svc_serverdata` + baselines + UI layout |
| `clc_move` | Store the `usercmd_t` for this client for use in `ge->ClientThink` |
| `clc_stringcmd` | Forward console commands to `SV_ExecuteClientCommand` |

### 2. SV_RunGameFrame

```c
void SV_RunGameFrame(void) {
    sv.framenum++;
    sv.time += FRAMETIME;
    ge->RunFrame();   // runs the game library's g_main.c G_RunFrame
}
```

`G_RunFrame` (in `games/warcraft-3/game/g_main.c`) iterates every live entity and calls `G_RunEntity`, which dispatches on `movetype` and calls the entity's `think` or `update` callback.

### 3. SV_SendClientMessages

For each connected client, `SV_BuildClientFrame` (`server/sv_ents.c`) collects the entities visible to that client into a snapshot. `SV_WriteFrameToClient` then delta-encodes the snapshot against the previous one using `MSG_WriteDeltaEntity` and transmits it as an `svc_packetentities` message.

After copying each authoritative `edict_t.s`, `SV_BuildClientFrame` calls the mandatory
`game_export.CustomizeEntity` hook. Games that do not author recipient-specific state must
export an explicit no-op; setting the hook to `NULL` crashes at the first visible entity.
WoW uses the hook for per-client quest markers, while WC3 and SC2 leave the copied state unchanged.

Delta compression ensures only changed entity fields are sent, keeping bandwidth usage low even with many active entities.

## Game Library Interface

The server communicates with the game library through two vtable structs defined in the selected game's API directory. For Warcraft III, that is `games/warcraft-3/game/api/`.

### `game_import_t` — server services provided to the game

The server fills this struct and passes it to `GetGameAPI`. It provides:

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `LinkEntity` / `UnlinkEntity` | Register an entity with the spatial index |
| `BoxEdicts` | Spatial query — all entities inside a bounding box |
| `Trace` | Sweep test against world geometry |
| `PointContents` | Terrain/water flags at a world position |
| `SetModel` | Assign a model by name to an entity |
| `MemAlloc` / `MemFree` | Server heap |
| `SetPaused` | Gate authoritative simulation while keeping server transport alive |
| `WriteXxx` | Network message write helpers |

### `game_export_t` — entry points exported by the game library

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `Init` | Called once at server startup |
| `Shutdown` | Called when the server shuts down |
| `SpawnEntities` | Parse map entities and place initial units |
| `RunFrame` | Advance simulation by one `FRAMETIME` tick |
| `ClientConnect` | Called when a new client slot is allocated |
| `ClientBegin` | Called when a client finishes loading the map |
| `ClientThink` | Per-frame input processing for each client |
| `ClientDisconnect` | Client disconnected — clean up player entity |

## Entity System

Entities are fixed-size `edict_t` structs stored in a flat array (`g_edicts[]`) in the game library. The server and game library share a read-only view of this array via `ge->edicts` and `ge->num_edicts`.

Each entity has:
- `entityState_t s` — the fields transmitted to clients (origin, angles, model index, frame, effects flags, …)
- `entityShared_t shared` — spatial data used by the server for link/unlink/trace (bounding box, link count, …)
- All other fields (health, AI, move state, callbacks) are game-library-private and never sent over the network

Only the `entityState_t` part is delta-encoded and sent to clients.

## Snapshots and Delta Compression

The server maintains a ring buffer of `clientSnapshot_t` records per client (in `server/sv_ents.c`). Each snapshot stores the full `entityState_t` set visible to that client at a given frame. `SV_WriteFrameToClient` compares the latest snapshot against the acknowledged one and emits only the fields that differ:

```c
// server/sv_ents.c
MSG_WriteDeltaEntity(&msg, &oldState, &newState, false, newState.number == cl->clientNum+1);
```

The client's acknowledged frame number is tracked per slot so the server can re-send if a snapshot was lost.

# WoW Weapons, Classes, and Combat Roles

## Weapon Types

WoW weapons are divided into melee and ranged categories. Each weapon type has an associated combat skill (removed in patch 4.0.1 but still relevant for class restrictions).

### Melee Weapons

### Weapon Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|

### Weapon Buffs

- Melee weapons of **Uncommon** quality or better have stat bonuses.
- Two-handed weapons have roughly double the bonuses of comparable one-handed weapons.
- Weapons are generally chosen for their stat bonuses and effects, not raw damage.

### Runtime server data

The initial WoW game module now consumes AzerothCore weapon damage data from
`games/world-of-warcraft/serverdata/weapons.csv`. Entry 37 (`Worn Axe`) is the
current player starter weapon; melee damage is rolled from its imported
1–3 damage range instead of using a hard-coded value. The table also retains
the starter shortsword, mace, and staff rows for the next equipment pass.

## Class Weapon Proficiencies

Each class can use specific weapon types. Warriors are the most versatile (all except Wands).

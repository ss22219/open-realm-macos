# World of Warcraft Grass Rendering System

## Overview

This document describes the WoW ground-effect rendering architecture. OpenWarcraft3 resolves the same terrain effect and detail M2 data used by the WoW client, then reuses the normal M2 material path.

> **Note:** authoritative M2 instancing is the active path. The camera-grid/height-atlas
> prototype remains disabled because it cannot yet preserve doodad geometry/material
> identity; see [static-grass-and-height-atlas.md](static-grass-and-height-atlas.md).

## Current OpenWarcraft3 Implementation

### Architecture

OpenWarcraft3 resolves ground clutter from the WoW MPQ data:

- `GroundEffectTexture.dbc` supplies terrain effects, doodad IDs, and amount/density; weighted layouts are version-dependent.
- `GroundEffectDoodad.dbc` resolves each doodad ID to its model name; in the bundled archive the model string is field 2, and `.mdl` names are normalized to `.m2`.
- Models are loaded from `World\\NoDXT\\Detail\\` and rendered through the normal M2 path, so embedded WoW material/texture references remain authoritative.
- ADT alpha coverage and height samples control whether and where each ground-effect model is placed.
- Placement randomness is deterministic per ADT chunk; renderer tuning and schema constants are named `WOW_GRASS_*` defines in `r_wowmap.h`.
- Ground-effect placements are compiled once per ADT window into persistent model groups.
- Road-like terrain layers are excluded when their sampled ADT coverage is at least `WOW_GRASS_ROAD_COVERAGE_MIN`; the heuristic follows WoWee's local layer-weight check.

### Instanced rendering

Ground-effect instances are rendered with **GPU instancing**, not one full `M2_RenderModel`
call per clump (which produced ~47k draw calls and dropped the frame rate by 10x):

- `Wow_AddGroundEffectInstance` initially links each placement into
  `wow_world.ground_effects`; the first `Wow_DrawGrass` groups it by model and builds each
  `MATRIX4` once.
- Each group uploads one `GL_STATIC_DRAW` instance VBO. The temporary matrices and linked
  placement nodes are then freed; ADT-window replacement releases the VBOs.
- `R_GameRenderModelInstanced` → `M2_RenderInstanced` (`r_m2.c`) renders each model batch once
  with `R_DrawBufferInstanced`, binding the persistent matrix VBO for `glDrawArraysInstanced`.
- `R_ModelShaderInstanced` (`r_shader.c`) is a copy of the model vertex shader with a per-instance
  `mat4 i_instance` attribute (4 vec4 columns, divisor 1) folded in instead of `uModelMatrix`; the
  fragment shader is the shared `model_fs`. It performs distance fade and root-anchored wind.
- `R_DrawBufferInstanced` (`r_buffer.c`) binds a shared VAO to the batch VBO plus an instanced
  matrix VBO and draws all group instances without re-uploading them.

The Classic detail assets inspected in Elwynn contain no keyed bone tracks. Wind is
therefore procedural GPU deformation, scaled from each model's authored Z bounds and
phased from the instance's world position; roots remain fixed.

The loader supports both known 11-DWORD layouts. It detects the bundled legacy layout (ID, date stamp, continent, zone, texture ID, four doodad IDs, density, sound) versus the modern weighted layout (ID, four doodad IDs, four weights, amount/coverage, terrain type) by resolving the candidate doodad IDs through `GroundEffectDoodad.dbc`. Legacy rows receive uniform weights for valid slots and ignore `0xffffffff`; modern rows retain their stored weights. `dbctool info` remains the first check when adding another client archive.

### Retired procedural prototype (historical)

The blade geometry, per-chunk grass buffers, procedural coloring, and budgets below
describe the removed prototype. They are retained only to explain why authoritative M2
instancing replaced it; they are not current renderer contracts. Current code uses the
instanced-M2 architecture above and the implementation checklist in
[static-grass-and-height-atlas.md](static-grass-and-height-atlas.md).

#### 1. Blade Generation (`r_wowmap_grass.c`)

The core grass building function processes 8x8 terrain chunks:

```c
void Wow_BuildGrassForChunk(wowAdtChunk_t *chunk,
                            BYTE const alpha[4][WOW_ALPHA_TEXELS],
                            wowLayer_t const *layers,
                            DWORD layer_count)
```

**Sampling Strategy:**
- Samples the 8x8 chunk grid at `WOW_GRASS_CELL_STEP` intervals.
- Each eligible sample selects weighted doodad models from the MPQ effect record.
- Each placement uses the ADT height map and is registered as a renderer-owned doodad instance.

**Placement Algorithm:**
1. Sample the alpha map at a grid position to determine terrain coverage.
2. Calculate attempts from the DBC amount/density field and alpha coverage.
3. Select a valid doodad ID uniformly from the four slots in `GroundEffectTexture.dbc`.
4. Resolve its model name through `GroundEffectDoodad.dbc`.
5. Sample height at a jittered position and place the M2 at that terrain height.

**Coloring:**
- Base green: 105-175 (varies per clump)
- Brown: 42-64 (dark brown)
- Dark blue: 28-46 (shadow/depth)
- Alpha: 220 (slightly transparent)

#### 2. Blade Geometry

Each clump consists of 2 perpendicular crossed triangles:

**First blade:**
- Base width: 0.22-0.44 units
- Height: 1.05-2.30 units
- Full alpha opacity

**Second blade (perpendicular):**
- Width: 85% of first blade (0.19-0.37 units)
- Height: 92% of first blade (0.97-2.12 units)
- Adds visual density without doubling fill rate

**Geometry Details:**
- Each triangle has 3 vertices (6 vertices total per clump)
- Normal vectors calculated from blade direction for proper lighting
- UV coordinates simple: (0,0) → (1,0) → (0.5,1) for tapered appearance

#### 3. Shader System (`r_wowmap_shader.c`)

**Vertex Shader:**
- Wind wave animation: `sin(time + dot(position.xy, vec2(0.071, 0.049)))`
- Wave amplitude: 0.22 units max deflection
- Maintains blade orientation while swaying

**Fragment Shader:**
- Distance-based fade: `smoothstep(WOW_GRASS_FADE_START_DISTANCE, WOW_GRASS_DRAW_DISTANCE)`
- Lighting calculation: 0.55-1.0 range (never fully dark)
- Alpha blending with back-to-front rendering

**Uniforms:**
- `uGrassTime`: Animated time value for wind
- `uGrassCameraOrigin`: Camera position for distance calculations
- `uGrassDrawDistance`: Maximum render distance (220.0 units)
- `uLightMatrix`: For proper lighting direction
- `uViewProjectionMatrix`: Standard 3D transform

### Data Structures

#### Layer Definition (wowLayer_t)
```c
typedef struct {
    DWORD texture_id;      // Terrain texture reference
    DWORD flags;           // Layer flags (detail, PBR, etc.)
    DWORD offset_in_mcal;  // Offset into alpha map data
    DWORD effect_id;       // GroundEffectTexture.dbc reference
} wowLayer_t;
```

The `effect_id` field (at offset +12 bytes) is the key link to grass configuration.

#### Chunk State (wowAdtChunk_t)
```c
VERTEX *grass_buffer;           // Vertex array object
DWORD num_grass_vertices;       // Vertex count
BOX3 grass_bounds;              // Bounding box for culling
```

### Performance

**Vertex Budget per Chunk:**
- Max clumps: 16 (4x4 grid) × 4 (per location) = 64
- Vertices per clump: 6
- **Max vertices per chunk: 384**
- **Memory per chunk: ~24 KB** (at 64 bytes per vertex)

**Draw Call Strategy:**
- All ground-effect instances are batched per model: one `glDrawArraysInstanced` per M2 batch, regardless of how many clumps use that model.
- Culled by squared distance (`WOW_GRASS_DRAW_DISTANCE`) and frustum before grouping.
- Typical visible cost: a handful of instanced draw calls (one per distinct model in view).

## Real World of Warcraft Implementation

### Architecture

WoW's data defines a **doodad-based system** using actual game asset models:

- **Data Source**: GroundEffectTexture.dbc maps terrain types to doodad models
- **Placement**: MCNK carries an 8x8 two-bit layer map and a 64-bit no-effect-doodad
  suppression map in addition to MCLY effects, MCAL coverage, and MCVT height
- **Models**: M2 doodad files with full animations and LOD support
- **Rendering**: The public data establishes M2 inputs, not Blizzard's exact batching path
- **Variety**: Up to 4 different grass/plant models per terrain type with weighted selection

### GroundEffectTexture.dbc / GroundEffectDoodad.dbc

The two 11-DWORD `GroundEffectTexture.dbc` layouts (legacy vs. modern weighted) and the `GroundEffectDoodad.dbc`
`id/doodad-path/flags` layout are documented in [`docs/dbc-reference.md`](dbc-reference.md#ground-effect--terrain-tables).

### Placement Algorithm

The exact original-client placement algorithm has not been established. The current
OpenWarcraft3 implementation uses the following MCAL-derived approximation:

1. **Determine grass layer**: Find layer with highest alpha coverage that has `effect_id != 0`
2. **Look up GroundEffectTexture**: Query `GroundEffectTexture.dbc[effect_id]`
3. **Select doodad**: Weighted random selection from 4 doodad options
4. **Calculate density**: Use `AmountAndCoverage` field to determine how many instances to place
5. **Sample placement**: Grid-based placement with jitter
6. **Sample height**: Use MCVT (height map) to place doodad on terrain surface
7. **Instance model**: Call doodad renderer with calculated transform

The redesign in [static-grass-and-height-atlas.md](static-grass-and-height-atlas.md)
first parses the MCNK layer/suppression maps and validates their orientation instead of
claiming the approximation is original-client behavior.

## ADT Chunk Format Integration

### Terrain Chunks (MCNK)

Each 8x8 unit terrain chunk contains:

**Layers (MCLY):**
```c
typedef struct {
    DWORD texture_id;      // Texture index in MMDX
    DWORD flags;
    DWORD offset_in_mcal;  // Offset into alpha data
    DWORD effect_id;       // >>> GRASS REFERENCE <<<
} wowLayer_t;
```

**Example scenario:**
- Layer 0: Stone texture, no effect_id (0)
- Layer 1: Grass texture, effect_id=5 (look up GroundEffectTexture.dbc[5])
- Layer 2: Snow texture, effect_id=0 (no grass)

MCAL determines terrain texture coverage. Do not infer that its percentage is also the
original client's ground-effect occupancy rule: MCNK has separate per-cell layer and
no-effect-doodad maps that must be parsed and validated.

### Height Map (MCVT)

The height map provides 9×9 height samples per chunk:
- Used to position grass at exact terrain height
- Interpolation within grid cells places grass on sloped terrain

### Alpha Maps (MCAL)

Four 64×64 alpha textures per chunk:
- Track blend amount for each layer
- Used to determine grass coverage at each sample point
- Format: mostly-opaque for layer 0, blend amounts for layers 1-3

## Improvements in OpenWarcraft3

### Phase 1: Data-Driven Integration (retired prototype)

**Added in this session:**

1. **GroundEffectTexture.dbc Loading**
   ```c
   static wowGroundEffectTexture_t wow_ground_effect_textures[512];
   static BOOL Wow_LoadGroundEffectDBCs(void);
   ```

2. **Helper Functions**
   - `Wow_GetGroundEffectTexture(effect_id)`: Lookup and cache
   - `Wow_SelectDoodadFromWeights(weights, seed)`: Weighted random selection
   - `Wow_GrassEffectIdForCoverage(...)`: Find dominant grass layer

3. **Data-Driven Coloring**
   - The retired prototype varied procedural blade colors from terrain data.
   - This is not a fallback: current rendering requires authoritative DBC and M2 data.

4. **Reason it was replaced**
   - Generic blade geometry could not preserve authored doodad shape or material identity.
   - Treating missing DBC data as procedural grass hid asset/data failures.

### Phase 2: Full Doodad System (Implemented)

**Done in this session** (replacing the Phase 1 blade generation):

1. **M2 Model Instantiation**
   - `Wow_AddGroundEffectInstance()` instantiates the resolved GroundEffectDoodad M2 per clump.
   - Instances are rendered through GPU instancing (`M2_RenderInstanced`), not per-instance model draws.

2. **Animation Support**
   - Verified Classic doodad M2s have zero keyed bone tracks despite a nominal sequence
   - The instanced vertex shader provides world-phased, root-anchored wind

3. **Appearance Variation**
   - Same grass placement, different visual assets
   - Weighted selection from 4 doodad options per terrain type
   - Much richer visual variety

4. **Material System**
   - Uses each M2's authoritative textures and material flags through the normal M2 path.

## Testing and Validation

### Required Data Files

**From World of Warcraft:**
- `DBFilesClient\GroundEffectTexture.dbc` - Terrain-to-doodad mapping
- `DBFilesClient\Map.dbc` - Map metadata
- `DBFilesClient\WorldSafeLocs.dbc` - Safe spawns
- `World\Maps\<map>\<map>.wdt` - WoW map tile index
- `World\Maps\<map>\<map>_<x>_<y>.adt` - WoW terrain chunks and ground-effect layer IDs

### Validation Tools

**MPQ Inspection:**
```bash
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/dbc.MPQ info 'DBFilesClient\GroundEffectTexture.dbc'
build/bin/dbctool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/dbc.MPQ info 'DBFilesClient\GroundEffectDoodad.dbc'
build/bin/mpqtool -mpq data/world-of-warcraft/terrain.MPQ ls 'World\Maps\Azeroth'
```

**Rendering Inspection:**
```bash
make run-wow ARGS="+set wow_playerinfo '\race\Human\sex\Male\class\1\appearance\0' +map playercreate +set r_stats 1 +com_frame_limit 300"
# At runtime, use `set r_grass 0` to isolate grass submission cost.
```

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Required DBC data**
   - GroundEffectTexture and GroundEffectDoodad are authoritative; missing records are
     logged and must be fixed rather than replaced with procedural colors or guessed models.

2. **Placement remains an approximation**
   - The public data establishes layer effects, density, suppression, models, and terrain
     height, but the exact original-client placement algorithm has not been confirmed.

3. **Animation source**
   - The inspected Classic detail M2s have no keyed bone tracks. Current movement is
     root-anchored GPU wind rather than nonexistent asset animation.

4. **No dedicated far LOD**
   - All resident instances use their authored M2 geometry. Add a far representation only
     if GPU vertex/fill profiling—not CPU submission—shows it is necessary.

## Conclusion

The current renderer resolves authoritative GroundEffect DBC records and M2 assets,
compiles immutable placement matrices once per ADT window, and submits persistent
instanced batches. Height placement is CPU work only during window construction;
distance fade, alpha coverage, and wind are GPU work. The procedural camera-grid path
remains disabled until it can preserve the same model and material identity.

# Hero revival

OpenRealm models Altar-style Hero revival as production of an existing Hero
entity, not as training a replacement unit.

## Capability

Revival capability is data-driven from the unit profile `Revive` (`urev`)
field. Any building whose normalized profile has a non-zero `Revive` value can
offer eligible dead Heroes owned by the same player. No Altar rawcode is
special-cased.

## Hero death state

Heroes keep their authoritative edict after death. When the death animation
finishes, `DissipateTime` is used for the Hero corpse/dissipation timer. At the
end of that timer the Hero is hidden and marked `revival.awaiting` instead of
being freed. `EVENT_PLAYER_HERO_REVIVABLE` and `EVENT_UNIT_HERO_REVIVABLE` are
published at that transition.

A dead Hero remains counted by `G_GetPlayerTechCountValue()`. This preserves
Hero/techtree limits while the Hero is dead. The same edict is not interactable as a
living unit during this period: `unit_die()` clears its selection mask and sets
`EF_NOT_SELECTABLE`, and `G_ReviveHero()` clears that flag when the Hero returns to its
living stand state. The shared death-animation, selection, and corpse-ordering contract is
documented in [WC3 Economy And Unit Presentation](economy-and-unit-presentation.md#unit-death-and-corpse-interaction).

## Command card and identity

A `Revive=true` building enumerates eligible dead Hero *instances*. Each button
uses the Hero unit's art and carries a `revive:<entity-number>` server command,
so multiple Heroes of the same type remain distinct. Queueing one Hero sets its
`reviving` flag immediately, which removes it from every other eligible
building's command card.

## Cost and time

The implementation reads the authoritative Misc gameplay constants:

```text
ReviveBaseFactor
ReviveLevelFactor
ReviveBaseLumberFactor
ReviveLumberLevelFactor
ReviveMaxFactor
ReviveTimeFactor
ReviveMaxTimeFactor
```

Gold uses the Hero's `goldCost`; lumber independently uses `lumberCost`. Cost
factors grow by Hero level and are capped by `ReviveMaxFactor`. Revival time is
the Hero's normal `buildTime * level * ReviveTimeFactor`, capped by
`ReviveMaxTimeFactor`.

Gold and lumber are charged when the Hero is inserted into the producer's
existing linked production queue. The Hero itself is the queue identity; a
separate `revival.queue_next` pointer avoids reusing its normal `build` field.
`revival.producer` identifies the queue that owns the Hero, while
`revival.player` records the player actually charged so cancellation cannot
refund a later owner after either entity changes ownership.

## Completion and cancellation

Only the queue head progresses. On completion the normal deterministic producer
exit search (`SP_FindUnitExitPosition`) finds a legal point beside the Altar,
then `G_ReviveHero()` restores the same Hero object. The scripted revive helper
also clears hidden/revival state and applies both mana terms:

```text
max mana * HeroReviveManaFactor
+ initial mana * HeroReviveManaStart
```

The finish event is published after the Hero is alive and positioned. An active
revival exposes the existing command-card Cancel action; cancellation refunds
the exact gold/lumber charged, clears `reviving`, and leaves the Hero awaiting
revival. Destroying a producer cancels/refunds all Hero revivals in its mixed
production chain and then cancels ordinary trainees. Removing a queued Hero,
scripted revival, and ownership transfer detach it through the same cancellation
path before the edict or owner state changes.

## Remaining gaps

- Exact proper-Hero-name formatting and a Hero-level number overlay are not yet
  represented by the current command-button wire format.
- Revival tooltip resource icons/cost fields are not represented separately by
  `gameCommandButton_t`; authoritative charging is implemented server-side.
- Altar Rally is applied after revive-finish events through the shared producer `G_ApplyRallyOrder`; see [rally-points.md](rally-points.md).
- Tavern/instant Hero awakening remains a separate future mechanic.
